Amazon is putting out to pasture a feature that let you try out apps in the browser before downloading them to your device 
While the concept may have sounded like a good way to check out a paid app it likely didn t line up with how most people buy apps Its most convenient to just browse on your device and try out the app right away especially with so many apps now going with the freemium model
