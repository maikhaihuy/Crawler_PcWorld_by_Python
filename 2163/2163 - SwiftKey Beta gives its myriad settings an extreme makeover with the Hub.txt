The new SwiftKey Beta attempts to clean up the app s numerous settings and put them within easy access of the keyboard 
The SwiftKey theme store and other settings have been moved to the Hub which is integrated right into the keyboard 
It s more of a reorganization than a major feature rollout but it s good to see SwiftKey continuing to push forward with its well regarded keyboard app
