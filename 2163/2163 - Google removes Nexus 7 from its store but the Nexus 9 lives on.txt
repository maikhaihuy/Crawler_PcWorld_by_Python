If you were looking to buy a Nexus 7 you re out of luck as Google s 7 inch tablet is no longer available for purchase from Google s online store 
One has to wonder whether the Nexus 7 s demise is a sign of things to come that is whether 7 inch tablets are feeling the squeeze from the proliferation of phones with enormous screens Although giant phones aren t for everyone if you have a 5 or 6 inch phone you might find it more difficult to justify a small tablet
