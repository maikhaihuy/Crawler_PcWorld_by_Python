E book subscription service Oyster has opened an online book store a move that pits the young company against heavyweight Amazon 
Oyster s ebook store has the support of the top five publishers in the U S While Amazon also offers books from these publishers Hachette HarperCollins Macmillan Penguin Random House and Simon Schuster it got into a nasty battle with them over pricing Amazon wanted to offer their books at steep discounts ignoring the publishers suggested prices 
The fight between Amazon and Hachette was especially toxic with Amazon preventing customers from pre ordering upcoming books from the publisher and threatening to stop stocking its titles The two parties resolved their dispute last November but didn t disclose the deal s terms None of the publishers immediately replied to questions regarding their negotiations and pricing arrangements with Oyster 
Oyster which launched in September 2013 faces a formidable competitor in Amazon The online retailer is the world s largest bookseller and estimated to control half of physical and ebook sales in the U S In addition to selling Kindle e readers Amazon also offers a Kindle app that runs on mobile devices from competitors like Apple and Samsung 
To use Oyster people download an app for mobile devices that run either iOS or Android
