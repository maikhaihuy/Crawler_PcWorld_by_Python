Most of those features won t be of much use to people who don t use stock Android phones Nexus Google Play Edition or Android One Most manufacturers enhance Android with their own quick settings menus support for carrier features like HD Voice or dual SIM support But the new device protection feature should be a welcome deterrent to theft for all phones that ship with Android 5 1 
Perhaps the best to come from its release will be more rapid updates from manufacturers who have not been as speedy in updating their phones to Android 5 0 as we hoped This is in part due to all the bugs in the initial release this major bugfix release might help grease the wheels on Android updates
