A serious flaw in a component that s used to authenticate clients on Wi Fi networks could expose Android Linux BSD and possibly Windows and Mac OS X systems to attacks 
The vulnerability is in wpa_supplicant an open source software implementation of the IEEE 802 11i specifications for wireless clients 
The component is cross platform and is used to control WPA and WPA2 wireless connections on Android Linux and BSD systems It can also be used by some third party wireless software on Mac OS X and Windows but these operating systems have their own built in supplicant implementations that are used by default 
The vulnerability stems from how wpa_supplicant parses SSID Service Set Identifier information from wireless network frames when the CONFIG_P2P option is enabled If exploited the flaw can allow attackers to crash the client denial of service read contents from the process s memory or inject arbitrary data into its memory which could result in arbitrary code execution 
The vulnerability was discovered by the hardware research group at Alibaba and was reported to the wpa_supplicant development team by the Google security team 
Users should install the security updates for wpa_supplicant when they become available for their operating systems A mitigation in the meantime is to disable P2P for each wireless interface in the wpa_supplicant configuration file by following instructions in the advisory 
Unfortunately wpa_supplicant is also used on embedded devices for which patches are not as frequently released or easy to install
