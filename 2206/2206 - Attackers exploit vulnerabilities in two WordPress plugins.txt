A vulnerability within two widely used WordPress plugins is already being exploited by hackers putting millions of WordPress sites at risk according to a computer security firm

The payload that is delivered is executed directly in the browser and doesn t go to the server Dede wrote That means Web application firewalls can t see it and stop it

For a successful attack a victim would have to be tricked into clicking on a malicious link 
Some hosting companies and services such as GoDaddy DreamHost and ClickHost have either done a virtual patch or taken other steps to protect users Dede wrote
