French lawmakers have taken a first step toward allowing real time surveillance of Internet and mobile phone use in France 
Lawmakers and citizens will have little opportunity to debate the French bill The French government by declaring the bill urgent ensured that each house of the French parliament will only read it once rather than shuttling it back and forth until they reach agreement on a text It still faces a number of obstacles before it can become law though If the upper house of the French Parliament the Senate approves the bill then a joint committee of the Senate and Assembly will iron out any differences between the texts voted by the two houses Finally the Constitutional Council is likely to be called on to strike out any provisions it deems unconstitutional
